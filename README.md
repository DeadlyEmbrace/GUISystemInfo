# GUISystemInfo
A program that get's information from a windows PC and writes it to a CSV file.

I made this program to help Inventory computers in my internship because I got tired of writing all the information down.

It did it's job well.

Keep in mind that this program is compiled in a old version of .net as it was ment to run on any computer win7 and above without updating .net.  

Wondering why its called GUISystemInfo? Because it started as a command line program but my co workers found it harder to use. So I made a GUI and called it this.
